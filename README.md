<p align="center"> My name is Nathan Doan. I live around Seattle, Washington and currently doing my Bachelors at Seattle Pacific University 👨‍🎓. Although I'm only still a student, a lot of my interests lie in developing and messing around with databases. With the rise of AI, I have been very interested in seeing where this all takes us and want to start exploring this field as I exit my educational career! 🤖</p>

<h1 align="center"> 🥇Biggest Project </h1>
 <p align="center"> You can see my most recent work under my <b>organizations</b> with a group of other amazing students! </p>
 <p align="center"> This project aimed to give students an easy way to register for classes in a clean and organized way under one website. (Gradplanningapp.com)</p>
 <p align="center"> 🎯 Personally, I learned a lot about setting up Node and trying to set it up and send API calls to our front page. As a team we had to learn how to setup our SQL database and create the tables and structure as well, which was a long process and took a couple months as we had no prior experience. In the end though, I am proud of our team and the project we made!</p>

  🐛 <b>A couple bugs:</b>
  <li>Searching for courses with no filters doesn't grab all courses in the database, some filters are applied for some reason.</li>
  <li>Some courses are partitioned into the wrong order, ocassionally a prereq course is sequenced before its parent course.</li>
  <li>The profile page is not fully responsive, the flowchart may overlap with it.</li>
